# Cloud specification for example.
#
# This document contains most if not all of the parameters we need to successfully deploy
# the service. Most of the top level objects like `elb` and `ecs` are modeled after
# the corresponding AWS infrastructure concepts and relevant API calls. The YAML format
# was chosen for better readability and documentability; to meet transport limitations and
# other factors we will be serializing this document into JSON form at the build time.
# Correspondingly, only the JSON compatible subset of YAML features is supported.
#
# N.B. Some IDEs might have lax(er) YAML parsers than the tooling we use, and won't highlight
# string values containing colon character (URLs, etc) as problematic, however it is recommended
# to quote URLs and other string values with colons using either single or double quotes, thusly:
#
# foo: 'https://foo.com' # or "https://foo.com"
#
# We do additional normalization on this data structure to allow for different parameters
# per environment at deployment time. Deployment environment name and service spec are two
# inputs, and the result is a data structure with values corresponding to the environment.
#
# The service spec document is traversed recursively and each value in it is resolved: if
# the data structure is an object and there is a key in it with the name exactly equaling
# to the environment name, we replace the parent structure with the value of that key.
#
# E.g.:
#
# foo:  # the value is an object
#   prestaging: prestaging-foo
#   staging: staging-foo
#   production: production-foo
#
# Will be flattened for 'production' into:
#
# foo: production-foo # the value is a scalar
#
# Environment keys that can be present in the data structures are not limited to the ones
# listed above; in fact any value can be used as a filter, it does not have to be an environment
# name. We do however provide a list of keys that we use as environment names, to facilitate
# validating the spec against each respective environment at build time.
#
# Tokens in shell variable expansion syntax such as ${VARIABLE_FOO} will be expanded to their
# respective values passed in command line to the tool we are using to validate and convert
# service specs to JSON. See Makefile for details.

# is also omitted from JSON spec output, however the references will be
# expanded into actual values wherever they are referenced.
