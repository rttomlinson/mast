# credentials and fails with an error; this error is transient and the operation
# is safe to retry after a short delay. The following environment variables configure
# AWS::CLIWrapper to do that.

# This variable's value is a Perl regex (can be just a string), and as such it may
# contain multiple patterns. Do not assume that error is the only line in stdout,
# use multi-line regex or simply omit anchors such as ^ and $.
